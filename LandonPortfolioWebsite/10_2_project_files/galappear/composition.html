      <h4>Acceptance</h4>
      <img src="img/gallery/acceptanceOne.png" alt="" class="responsive-img"> 
      Acceptance is a freely-atonal chamber piece for Cello and Piano about 6 and a half minutes long. The piece utilizes extended techniques for both performers. The pianist is asked to perform one section by standing up and plucking the strings of the piano by hand while holding down the pedal.  The Cellist is asked to perform two different extended techniques. The first of those is the "air noise" which is acheived by lightly placing multiple fingers over the strings to obstruct their normal vibration. Very light bowing will get a subtle air noise that almost has a pitch but does not have any resonant tone. Another technique is the grotesque vibrato which is a hyper-vibrato that is wider in terms of the area that the fingers move,extended past molto vibrato. It should sound more intense than any common practice vibrato. <br>
      <p>The form and tonal development of the piece is inspired by a list of expressive markings that define the emotion of each section. These markings are <i>Introspectively, Aggressively, Furiosly, </i> and <i>Peacfully.</i></p> <br>
      <i id="CompHeader">Introspectively</i>
							<p>The performers are asked to play in a rubato style, being free with the accuracy of the rhythms and also to be free with the interpretation of the space between beats. The performers are also asked to play with a light to medium touch avoiding a heavy or staccato tone. Imagine studying and reflecting on the music as you play it and how the music should feel based on the expressive marking.</p>

							<i id="CompHeader">Aggressively</i>
							<p>The performers are asked to now abandon the rubato style rhythmically and play as accurately in 	time as possible. The performers are also asked to play with the <i>intensity</i> of Forte at 	every dynamic marking; playing heavily instead of lightly. The performers are asked to try to 	get into an intense state of mind and treat the performance as such.</p>

							<i id="CompHeader">Furiously</i>
							<p>This Expression marking is used on fast rhythmic figures containing 32nd notes. The performers 	are asked to play these sections as fast as possible and not focus on playing the rhythms 		perfectly. The performers are also asked to play with as heavy of a touch that the speed of 	the rhythms allows.  Get into a furious state of mind with “tunnel vision” ignoring everything 	else.</p>

							<i id="CompHeader">Peacefully</i>
							<p>This is the last expressive marking of the piece. The performers are asked to put themselves in the state of mind of someone who has accepted a dismal situation and has come to terms with it and now feels peaceful. Light touch, calm dynamics, and rhythmic rubato. This rubato should be even more spacious and peaceful than previous rubato during the <i>Introspective</i> sections.</p>

      <h4>Metamorphose</h4>
      <img src="img/gallery/metamorphose.png" alt="" class="responsive-img"> <br>
            The title Metamorphose is a play on the word metamorphosis. This piece develops much
            in the way that most through-composed pieces do in that each section feels like a new
            texture/tonal area which mirrors the title. <br>
            Beginning at measure 16 there is an extended technique which is drawn like a glissando,
            but is in fact not. When the performer sees this shape, they are to hold the bow firmly
            against the strings and rock the bow back and forth creating a muted, crunchy sound. The
            pitches labeled with this shape are just to indicate motion and the player need not try to
            aim for these pitches at all. This technique happens at measure 16, 47, 52, 54, 65, and 66.
            Each player should experiment with this technique to figure out how to produce the desired
            marked dynamics.
